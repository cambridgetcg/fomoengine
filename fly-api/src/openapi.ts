        "Deterministic FOMO/manipulation detector: scans submitted HTML or text for engineered fear-of-missing-out mechanics, staged per the FOMOENGINE loop with FTC-taxonomy receipts. Remote URL retrieval is paused: this service does not make server-side requests to untrusted destinations. JSON request bodies are limited to 2,000,000 bytes. Scans also carry a `rhetoric` block (rhetorlint/0.1 spec): rhetorical tells in the words — agentless passives, hedges, universal absolutes — reported alongside the FOMO score, never folded into it. `rhetoric` reads a declared bounded prefix on very large documents and is null only if the rhetoric analyzer itself fails (the scan is still delivered). Free doors: /manual (the framework as data) and /honeypot (a test page that should score ~100)." +
